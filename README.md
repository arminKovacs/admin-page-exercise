# Admin page exercise

## Useful feature 1: Filtering products by name, by price, by discount

- It could be helpful when there are more products for an admin panel to filter the list for specific needs.

## Useful feature 2: Analytics for products

- Providing different type of analytics like total monthly revenue, number of users etc. For sales purposes it is helpful. (I would implement these metrics in a different data model it is only done for this projects scale and simplicity)
